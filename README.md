# Analog Clock

Welcome to the Analog Clock project! This project demonstrates the creation of a dynamic and visually appealing analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock not only displays the current time with moving hour, minute, and second hands but also shows the current day and date, providing a comprehensive timekeeping tool.

## Key Features
1. **Analog Clock Design**: The clock features a classic analog design with numbers 1 to 12 positioned around the clock face.
2. **Dynamic Hands Movement**: The hour, minute, and second hands move smoothly to reflect the current time accurately.
3. **Current Date and Day Display**: A separate section below the clock displays the current date and the day of the week.
4. **Responsive Design**: The clock is designed to be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes for optimal viewing.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the clock and date-day container.
- **CSS**: Styling the clock, including positioning of numbers, hands, and center dot.
- **JavaScript**: Script to update the clock hands in real-time and display the current date and day.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the clock and date-day container.
- **Style.css**: Holds the CSS styles for the clock's appearance and layout.
- **script.js**: Includes the JavaScript code to handle the real-time updating of the clock hands and date/day information.

## How It Works
- The `HTML` provides the structural elements, including the clock face and placeholders for the numbers, hands, and date/day information.
- The `CSS` uses custom properties and positioning to style the clock elements, ensuring they are placed correctly around the clock face.
- The `JavaScript` code updates the positions of the clock hands every second based on the current time. It also updates the day and date information in the dedicated container.

This project is an excellent example of combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and functional web component. It can be used as a standalone clock on a webpage or integrated into larger web applications where a visual representation of time is needed.
